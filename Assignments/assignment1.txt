1. Explain the use of JavaScript ( or What you can do using a JavaScript)
-> The primary use of JavaScript is to build web-based applications. Some of what JavaScript can
do for the web includes:
A. adding interactive behavior to web pages like zooming in and out or playing audio/video
B. creating web and mobile apps, the most popular examples consist of the likes of Netflix and Uber
C. building web servers and server-side applications using Node.js
D. create games that operate inside the browser

2. What is the difference between client-side and server-side?
-> Client-side means that the processing takes place on the user's computer.
It requires browsers to run the scripts on the client machine without involving any processing on the server.
Server-side means that the processing takes place on a web server.

3. What is Nodejs?
-> Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser.This allows Node.js to be very performant.
A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. 
Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, 
libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

4. Explain Scope in JavaScript
-> Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.
JavaScript has 3 types of scope:
A. Block scope : ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.
Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope. Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.

B. Function scope : JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.
Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.
They all have Function Scope.

C. Global scope : Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.
Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.
They all have Global Scope.

5. JavaScript is asynchronous or synchronous.
-> At its base, JavaScript is a synchronous, blocking, single-threaded language.
That just means that only one operation can be in progress at a time.

6. JavaScript is Single-threaded or Multi-threaded.
->JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means it has only one call stack that is used to execute the program.

7. Explain DOM in your own word.
-> The DOM (Document Object Model) is an interface that represents how your HTML and XML documents are read by the browser.
It allows a language (JavaScript) to manipulate, structure, and style your website.
