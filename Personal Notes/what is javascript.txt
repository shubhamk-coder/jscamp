JavaScript is a just-in-time (JIT) compiled, multi-paradigm programming language with dynamic typing.
Combined with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the leading technologies used in the World Wide Web. 

Initially, JavaScript could only be used on the client-side – that is, web browsers. But with Node.js, a cross-platform runtime environment for JavaScript, code can be written and executed server-side. 

Nearly every browser has an exclusive JavaScript engine to execute code. And most websites depend on JavaScript for their client-side behavior. 

JavaScript’s JIT compiler is especially noteworthy. Interpreted languages are known for being slower than compiled languages. But the JIT compiler is a feature of the run-time interpreter. 

With it, you can have the advantages of an interpreted language like dynamic typing alongside the advantages of compiled code like stricter error prevention.

Dynamic typing is another feature of JavaScript. This feature signifies looser restrictions around variable declarations. 

Similarly, object-oriented programming, one of the multiple programming paradigms that JavaScript supports, gives developers the flexibility to think more intuitively.
